## User Experience
Designed specifically for technicians who need maximum simplicity and minimal learning curve. All interfaces prioritize ease of use over complex features.

## Technical Details
For implementation details and technical specifications, refer to `/back-office/CLAUDE.md` and the global `/CLAUDE.md` file.

## Getting Started
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Build for production
yarn build
```

## Test Access Flow
Enable the shared demo mode so early testers can navigate the full back-office without real data.

### 1) Configure environment variables
Create `.env` with the following keys (values should match the same Firebase project):
```bash
NUXT_PUBLIC_TEST_ACCESS_ENABLED=true
NUXT_PUBLIC_TEST_TECHNICIAN_SLUG=instalapro-demo       # Slug used on the booking site
NUXT_TEST_ACCESS_CODE=SHARE_THIS_CODE_WITH_TESTERS     # Secure string that testers will type
NUXT_TEST_USER_UID=instalapro-demo-user                # UID used for the seeded dataset
NUXT_FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT='{"type":"service_account",...}'  # JSON or base64 string
```
You can also export the service account path or base64 value instead of the inline JSON:
```bash
export FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=/absolute/path/to/service-account.json
# or
export FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(cat service-account.json | base64)
```

### 2) Seed the Firebase project
Run the helper script once per project to create the demo user, technician, services, clients, jobs and slot availability:
```bash
cd back-office
yarn seed:test-data
```
Optional overrides:
```bash
TEST_USER_UID=instalapro-demo-user \
TEST_USER_EMAIL=demo.tech@instalapro.com \
TEST_TECHNICIAN_SLUG=instalapro-demo \
node scripts/seed-test-data.js
```
> The script is idempotent; running it again refreshes the sample data without duplicating records.

### 3) Share the testing credentials
- **Back-office:** testers visit `/sign-in`, click ‚ÄúUsar c√≥digo de prueba‚Äù and enter `NUXT_TEST_ACCESS_CODE`.
- **Booking:** send the generated URL `https://your-booking-host/${NUXT_PUBLIC_TEST_TECHNICIAN_SLUG}` so they can explore the client-facing flow.

Ensure the same `TEST_USER_UID` value is used everywhere (environment variables, seeding script and Firebase Auth). When deployed, the new `/api/test-access` endpoint issues a custom token for that user and loads the seeded dataset automatically.
