## Technical Details
For implementation details and technical specifications, refer to `/booking/CLAUDE.md` and the global `/CLAUDE.md` file.

## Getting Started
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Build for production
yarn build
```

## Demo Technician Link
When the back-office demo mode is configured, set `NUXT_PUBLIC_TEST_TECHNICIAN_SLUG` in `.env` and share the booking URL:
```bash
https://your-booking-host/${NUXT_PUBLIC_TEST_TECHNICIAN_SLUG}
```
That slug is seeded by `back-office/scripts/seed-test-data.js`, so both apps read the same sample technician profile.
