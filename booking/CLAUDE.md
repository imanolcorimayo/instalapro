# InstalarPro Booking - Client Appointment Interface

## Domain Overview
**URL**: https://agenda.instalapro.com/{technician}  
**Purpose**: Individual technician booking pages for their clients  
**Target Users**: End customers who received the booking link directly from their technician
**Primary Goal**: Convert booking requests into confirmed appointments with minimal friction

## Business Model Clarification
**IMPORTANT**: Each technician gets their own individual booking page after setting up their account in back-office.
- Technicians share their unique booking URL directly with their clients
- Each URL is customized for that specific technician: `agenda.instalapro.com/{technician}`
- Clients only see and book with the one technician who shared the link
- We NEVER have a technician directory or public listing - each page is private to that technician's clients
- This is NOT a marketplace - it's individual booking pages for each technician's business

## Core Philosophy: Ultra-Simple UX

### Design Priorities (In Order)
1. **MOBILE FIRST** - 90% of users will book via smartphone
2. **MINIMAL STEPS** - 3 screens maximum: Service → Time → Confirmation  
3. **NO REGISTRATION** - Phone number is the only required identifier
4. **INSTANT FEEDBACK** - Real-time availability, immediate confirmation
5. **WHATSAPP NATIVE** - Leverage familiar communication patterns

## Mobile-First Design System

### Touch-Friendly Interface
- **Button Size**: Minimum 44px height for touch targets
- **Spacing**: Generous padding between interactive elements  
- **Typography**: Minimum 16px font size to prevent zoom
- **Form Fields**: Large, clearly labeled input fields
- **Loading States**: Clear feedback for all user actions

### Data Synchronization
- **Technician Profile**: Sync individual technician's profile from back-office
- **Services**: Pull that specific technician's service catalog and pricing
- **Availability**: Get real-time availability for that technician only
- **Booking Requests**: Submit booking requests to that technician's back-office

## Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Common Scenarios
- **Invalid Technician URL**: Redirect to main site with message
- **No Availability**: Show "Próxima disponibilidad" with calendar
- **Booking Conflicts**: Real-time conflict detection and alternative suggestions
- **Form Validation**: Inline validation with clear error messages
- **Network Issues**: Offline detection with retry mechanisms

## Performance Optimization

### Loading Strategy
- **Critical CSS**: Inline critical styles for above-fold content
- **Progressive Loading**: Show service selection while availability loads
- **Image Optimization**: Optimized technician photos, lazy loading
- **Prefetching**: Prefetch likely next steps in booking flow
